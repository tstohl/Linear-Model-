knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


###Plot scatterplot

```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```
```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
```
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
```
 
The y-axis is SIMS and the x-axis is ARM. This plot shows that there is a positive linear correlation.
